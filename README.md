File Permissions in Linux üêß üîí
This repository contains information and examples related to file permissions in Linux. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to review and modify file permissions to ensure security and access control within a specific directory.

Summary
In this project, we focused on the projects directory and performed the following steps:

Reviewing File and Directory Information: We used the ls -la command to display a detailed listing of file contents, including hidden files, within the projects directory. We analyzed the permissions string to determine the access rights for users, groups, and others.

Changing File Permissions: We utilized the chmod command to modify file permissions. For example, we removed write access for "other" on a file named project_k.txt using the command chmod o-w project_k.txt.

Changing Permissions on Hidden Files: We archived a hidden file named .project_x.txt and adjusted its permissions. We removed write permissions for the user and group, and added read permissions for the group using commands like chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt.

Changing Directory Permissions: We modified the permissions for the drafts directory to restrict access. We removed execute permissions for groups using the chmod command, ensuring that only the researcher2 user had access.

These steps helped ensure that only authorized individuals had the appropriate level of access to files and directories in the projects directory, contributing to a secure system.
